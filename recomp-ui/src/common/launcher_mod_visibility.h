/* Which mod features and packages the launcher presents to the player.
 *
 * Default (provider hide_hidden_features == 0, every existing title): a
 * feature marked `hidden` is listed only while it is enabled, so it can be
 * turned off again, and every package is listed.
 *
 * Opt-in (hide_hidden_features != 0, set by the host for its title): a hidden
 * feature is never presented -- not in the Mods list, the lobby picker or its
 * summary, not as the detail pane's selection -- and "Enable all" /
 * "Disable all" leave it alone. It still runs exactly as its package and the
 * player's saved state say, so a hidden default-on feature is simply active.
 * A package whose every feature is hidden is not listed under "Installed
 * packages" either. Providers without the feature surface have no hidden
 * flag, so all of their packages are presented. */
