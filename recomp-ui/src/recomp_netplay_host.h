/*
 * recomp_netplay_host.h -- the launcher's netplay backend, shared.
 *
 * RecompLauncherCNetplayCallbacks implemented once, over recomp-net's lobby
 * protocol client (recomp_net/lobby_client.h) and its LAN modules
 * (lan_lobby / lan_direct / lan_beacon). An engine fills one hook struct,
 * calls recomp_netplay_host_init, and hands recomp_netplay_host_callbacks()
 * to RecompLauncherCGameInfo.netplay. It does not copy create / join /
 * fill_launch glue into each engine: that copying is how snesrecomp,
 * psxrecomp and (almost) n64lle each grew their own lobby.
 *
 * Lifted from snesrecomp runner/src/netplay/snes_host_lobby.c (snesrecomp
 * 36d6ce5), which is now a thin adapter over this file.
 *
 * OPTIONAL: built only when the consumer provides recomp-net
 * (recomp_target_launcher_netplay() in recomp_ui.cmake). recomp-ui itself
 * builds and runs without it; every callback in the launcher is NULL-guarded.
 *
 * Contract details the launcher relies on are in docs/HOST_NETPLAY.md.
 *
 * Not thread-safe; call from the thread that pumps the launcher, and from the
 * game's thread after it (the lobby client is process-global).

/* How lobby seats become session slots at launch.
 *
 * HOST_FIRST (the default, and the contract in docs/HOST_NETPLAY.md): the
 * lobby host is ALWAYS session slot 0 -- the sim authority every host-only
 * path keys on -- whatever seat it holds; the other players follow in seat
 * order; slot_port[] maps each session slot to the controller port of its
 * LOBBY seat, and occupied_mask covers exactly the seated players. The
 * engine MUST honour slot_port[] or a moved seat lands on the wrong port.
 *
 * SEAT (legacy): session slot == lobby seat == port. slot_port[] is filled
 * as the identity and occupied_mask from the seats, so the launch is still
 * complete, but whoever sits in seat 0 is the sim authority. For an engine
 * that does not consume slot_port[] yet (snesrecomp today). A launch with the
 * host in the gallery is REFUSED under this policy, since the host has no
 * seat to be the slot of. */
