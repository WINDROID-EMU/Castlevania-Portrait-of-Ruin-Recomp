/* Genesis controller/lobby seat ceiling in launcher_model_init().

 * The Genesis SystemProfile ceiling is the engine's four logical players

 * GameInfo.num_players stays the per-game capability. Sonic 2's party mod
 * declares four players and must get four controller cards and four lobby
 * seats; every two-port Genesis title must keep exactly two, and nothing may
 * exceed the four the engine and bind store can route.
 *
 * Includes the model translation unit (as launcher_pad_mode_test.c does). */
